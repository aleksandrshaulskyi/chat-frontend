# Chat-frontend.

Modern UI layer for the distributed chat platform

A clean, modular, feature-oriented frontend built for the distributed chat system.
Designed for clarity, scalability, and seamless integration with the backend microservices.

## 🚀 Overview

Chat-frontend provides the user interface for the entire distributed chat platform — from authentication and message flows to real-time updates and chat navigation.

The app supports both development and production modes and is structured using Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) to ensure clean boundaries, predictable scaling, and long-term maintainability.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The application was tested primarily in Google Chrome on macOS 26.1.
Compatibility with other browsers is not guaranteed (yet).

## 🏗️ Architecture (Feature-Sliced Design)

The frontend follows the Feature-Sliced Design methodology — a modern, scalable architecture originally built for large React applications.
